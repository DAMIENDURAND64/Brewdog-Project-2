                The brewery was established in 2007 by Martin Dickie and James
                Watt. Both twenty-four years old at the time, we rented set up
                in Fraserburgh, took out some bank loans a little scary, slammed
                all our money into stainless steel and we took to brewing pure,
                hard craft beers. We brewed a beer at 55Â° and packaged it in
                bodies of road-killed and stuffed animals. It was the beer most
                expensive in the world, and also an unlikely encounter between
                three worlds apart: art, craft beer and taxidermy. We opened 17
                bars and we also installed a top canning line in our Ellon
                brewery
